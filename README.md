# Dialogflow Chatbot

A new Flutter Dialogflow project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter Dialogflow application.

A few resources that inspired me with this project:

- [Medium: Kleber Andrade - Criando um Chatbot com Flutter e DialogFlow](https://medium.com/flutter-comunidade-br/criando-um-chatbot-com-flutter-e-dialogflow-f828e5301101)
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## TODO

- Change the message style, using a Clippy like WhatsApp's one ([clippy_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/clippy_flutter))
- Add date/hour on messages ([DateTime class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime-class.html))
